        - Urban slaves that do small menial tasks, but owners use them as a status symbol
        - Widows would hang onto slaves
    - Independence
      - Slave owners free a lot of their slaves because of attachment of slaves to families (esp Creole born slaves); happens mostly to female slaves
      - Mining and artisanship/urban slaves are more likely to buy their own freedom
      - When freeing a slave, all the kids of the slave are free
        (born to slave = slave, born to free = free)
        - This contributes to the growing number of free blacks in Latin Am
      - Many free blacks work in the lower levels of society, so freedom does NOT give them economic advancement
        - But they much prefer being free and making a wage rather than being a slave

  - 1888 Slavery is abolished in Brazil; similar time when it was banned in Spanish Latin America
