=========================================
Mature period (1570-1750's) of Latin America
  - Demography
    - Exponential growth of all demographic groups
    - Indigenous people population fell during the conquest (90% dead), but slow recovery until 1650's when population really grows again
  - Inquisition of Latin America
  - Government Structure
    - Institutions were already all in place
    - Growing need to grow the bureaucracy
    - Recopilacion
    - Sale of offices (remember this)
      - Start with sale of local offices (municipal, etc)
        - Started in 1558
      - 1606: Started selling titles/positions of nobility
        - These would last for lifetime
        - These positions can be inherited too (provided a tax is paid)
      - Why did the Crown do this?
        - Late 16th century, too many wars in Europe (esp against England), and it was very expensive
        - Response to increased piracy in the Caribbean (Queen Elizabeth is supporting piracy)
          - Spanish is losing a lot of wealth from piracy
        - Francisco Drake
          - Attacked 2 key ports and sacked them (Santo Domingo and something else)
        - Spanish Armada is completely destroyed by the English in 1588
        - 1633 Start selling treasury posts
        - 1690 Selling viceroys
        - Only local administrative positions could be inherited, the other positions could not be passed down
        - REMEMBER the progression starting in 1606 -> selling viceroys
  - More people living in cities
  - Increase in mixed race population
  - Society
    - The original idea was to have two separate republics
      - Indigenous groups have their group
        - Spanish tried to turn semi-sedentary groups into sedentary groups (Republica De Indios)
          - Congregate them and convert them inside of towns that they don't live in
          - Spanish were moderately successful with this strategy
      - Spanish have their own (Republica De Espanoles)
    - The two separate republics did not work out because there was a lot of mixing between groups
    - Intermarriage created a group of new people
      - These people possessed Spanish culture
    - Hierarchy of society
        Spanish
        Mestizo - Mix of Spanish and indigenous blood & sociocultural states, higher than Mulatto bc they look closer to Spanish
        Mulatto - Mix of black and Spanish
        Black - Blacks are closer to the Spanish (spoke Spanish & Christianized), hence why they are higher than Indians
        Indians
      - Castizo and Morisco are very high up in the social ladder
      - Zambo are seen very negatively, since people should be mixing with the Spanish
    - People can change their label based on their wealth (fluidity)
      - Pay to change documents & pay for witnesses to justify to elevate social status
    - Indigenous people had better legal status than slaves even being lower socially, because many blacks were slaves
    - Cities
      - Spanish & indigenous people live side by side, lots of mixing in living conditions
      - Mixing in the workplace
