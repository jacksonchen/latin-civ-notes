---------------------

Note the demography of Latin Am is changing
  - Number of migrants coming from Spain goes up during Mature and esp Late Period
  - Indigenous rates started finally going up in the late period
    - They buy more and more European product and getting into the cash economy
  - This creates a very complex market in Latin Am

Hacienda
  - Typical product to market: Cattle, wheat
  - Then later (esp in Mexico) started production of alcoholic beverages (e.g tequila)
  - More and more concentration of property at the very top

Out in the countryside
  - Changes of where people are working in hacienda
    - Lot more mixed groups working in the countryside
  - These ordinary will never become rich but they are able to sell more variety to the markets
  - Production is government driven in haciendas
  - Sharecroppers
    - Previously temporary Natives who work and then go back to their communities
    - Also share of permanent workers who just live on the hacienda
  - Ranchos
    - Independently owned (not like sharecroppers who rent out land)

Mining
  - Mature period: Mercury and the ___ process, drove the story of mining since the Mature Period to today
  - More supply of mercury coming from Spain (found a better way of extracting mercury from there)
  - Potosi Mine & other mines depend on mercury from Spain
  - Spain is why Mexican mines are more profitable because they had greater access to mercury
  - Gunpowder is starting to be used to dig tunnels
  - Higher concentration of mining families amongst poor people
  - More and more independent indigenous workers in mining (look at Andes with existing Inca system)

La Plata and north of Argentina
  - Fringe area since very few people live there
  - Produce a wide variety (hides, clothing, etc)
  - Spanish decide to move silver down to Buenos Aires rather than all the way up to Havana
  - Port of Buenos Aires than becomes a key port as a result
  - A new vice royalty (of La Plata) needed to become created since the area became so important to the empire
  - Cacao plantations become big here
    - Sending it to Mexico to source the cacao beverage
    - Start sending it in significant quantities to the European market

1739 Institutional Development
  - Venezuela is set as captaincy general because Spain needed control of it

Document

  - What:
    - How whiteness is spread through offspring (?)
    - Calamity if there is no white blood in your family

    - Urban countryside split

Other changes
  - The racial split is important to see independence struggle
  - Creole people getting in more and more in power in office (except Vice Royalty)
  - Merchants become way more powerful in this period - they also own land usually
  - All the top merchants are Spanish
  - Son of merchants are put in charge of the land (or mine) that the merchant family owns
    - Who will take on the merchant business then?
    - Usually call on a nephew from Spain to come to the lands and take charge of the merchant business
  - More and more hispanized in the countryside since more Spaniards are moving out
    - Also more and more indigenous people living on hacienda land
  - We also we more and more indigenous people going against hacienda (late colonial period)

Underclass
  - Urban poor (fairly modern concept)
  - Process of migration to cities that becomes more effort in late period
  - Very visible in capitals (Mexico City, Lima)
  - Rising crime attached to this population
  - Very modern term/concept
