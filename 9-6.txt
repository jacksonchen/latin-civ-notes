  - No iron, no steel
  - Trade was with cacao beans or barter; no currency
  - No big animals in Meso-America
  - Altepetl
    - The local unit of organization in Aztec society
    - Portion of region linked by kinship
    - Characterized by a dense core/center and surrounding argricultural land
  - Formalization of Polygamy
  - Land ownership (Aztec)
    - Lords and nobles (including priests) are land owners
    - Emperor is the real owner of the rest of the land, but he "allows" aristocrats to use it
    - Lords, nobles & emperors have separate ownership of land
  - Aztec warfare & human sacrifice
    - Aztecs is a militarized society with warriors
    - Through warfare, they get prisoners for sacrifices, for tributes (for military), for labor
    - Also get lands
    - They treated sacrifice as something that allows the sun to rise, rain to come, etc
  - Diff between Mayans and Aztecs
    - Mayans don't have imperial structure; they have many city states (with inter-state relationships and conflicts)
      - Lots of conflicts with Mayans
      - Started 2000 BCE
      - 900 BCE environmental factors (agricultural system started to fail because cities were too big)
      - When Spaniards went there, there was pretty much no Mayan civilization (cities were abandoned from starvation, etc)
  - Look at pg 13
  - Mayans were the only civilization writing with sounds (Aztecs used pictograms)

Mayeques
  - Really low social class in Aztec civilization: Pretty much slavery
  - Slaves come from POW's
