Spinsters
  - Demographics where women in upper classes did not have access to large enough dowries to marry.
  - Celibate spinsters only existed amongst elites

Concubines "mala amistad"
  - Colonial non-elites couldn't afford weddings and didn't gain from being a part of the church
  - So they remained unmarried (but had marriage-like relationships)

Female illegitimate children married less frequently than male counterparts

Single mothers were more common in cities because of job opportunities
  Lack of marriage nor the covenant usually due to race and/or social status

Widows
  - Women more frequently widowed
  - Sometimes the patriarchal families became matriarchal families

Work
  - Elite women were not supposed to be working, or at least seen in the public sphere working
