Treaty of Madrid 1750
Law of Consolidation 1804
  - Decree by Bourbon to push Church to relinquish any properties acquired through chaptaincies
  - All property owned directly by Church also needed to be relinquished
  - The Crown is trying to control the property that the Church has access to, on its own terms
  - In theory, would have curtails the power of the Church, but in practice, doesn't get implemented because it would upset the whole colonial system
Royal Pragmatic on Marriages 1778
  - Give parents a legal weapon to control marriage choices of their children
  - If children marry outside of official status (going below social status), parents can use this law to prevent the marriage
Royal Decree of Prices for Gracias Al Sacar 1795
  - Established list of prices people can pay to declare whiteness (i.e to be declared white in colonial society)

Bourbon Reforms (start with Philip V)
  - Start in 1750
  - Make the empire more rational and more efficient
  - Collect taxes more efficiently
  - More aggressive foreign intervention
  - Role of the Spanish king is continued to be unquestioned
  - Actual reforms
    - Ministers are created assume some of the key roles of the Councils
      - Bourbons think having one person as strongman is more efficient than a council
    - Two new Vice Royalties come into place
      - New Grenada (in modern day Colombia and Venezuela and Panama) in 1739
        - In 1777, Venezuela would become a capital within the Vice Royalty (i.e autonomous administration)
      - La Plata (in modern day Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia) in 1776
        - Main reason is for economic development, agriculture economy, and the transport of silver to Buenos Aires
        - Purpose of having Vice Royalties is for better control and taxation (Bourbon thought)
    - Establishment of the Intendant role that replace mayores, gobernadores
    - Subdelegado replace corregidor
      - To collect taxes from the indigenous countryside
      - In reality, there wasn't much change
      - Keep many resources for themselves

British Occupation of Havana
  - Shift the way the Crown's strategy on defense
  - Spain never had standing armies in Latin America except on the periphery to defend against Natives and garrisons in key ports
  - After occupation, Crown thought it's better to have mobilized standing armies in Latin America rather than just garrisons
  - Generals are all appointed in Spain
  - The British had issues during occupation
    - Yellow fever kills off a lot of British soldiers, yet all the Spanish, Native, and Blacks are immune
    - This makes Britain willing to ceded Havana
  - Spain also invested in bringing militias up to speed
  - Defense now becomes very expensive (hence need better taxation system)
  - Also a defense mechanism against Independence movements that will soon come

Trade
  - Crown wanted to have better control of trading system and resources
  - Crown scale up on royal monopolies (e.g mercury, gunpowder, tobacco, alcoholic beverages)
  - Declare free trade in the empire in 1778
    - Ports are opened up for free trade within the empire (not other countries)
    - Free trade did not apply to Mexico (considered the core of the empire system and didn't want to let go) and Venezuela (because of Crown-established monopoly)
    - 1789: Entire empire incl. Mexico declared under free trade

Church Reforms under Bourbon
  - Bourbon wanted to bring Latin American church under control
  - Expulsion of the Jesuits from all Spanish American colonies in 1767
    - Note: Spain isn't the first to do this, Portugal was the first in 1759, then France in 1764
    - Reason for expulsion: Series of upheavals in Spain, and Jesuits were found responsible for this
    - Jesuits have a lot of power in local society (they controlled a lot of the schooling for example), and could become independent
    - 700 expelled in Mexico and 500 in Paraguay, mostly Creoles and expelled from the places where they grew up
    - A lot of Creole and indigenous people were upset -> later leads to independence struggles
    - Jesuit property now goes to the Crown
  - Secularization: Whenever a Parish priest retired, it would be replaced with secular clergy
    - Bourbons in 1749 decreed all parishes under priests of religious order must be secularized
  - Law of Consolidation 1804
  - A lot of the Church reforms were watered down in practice or not implemented at all

More Bourbon reforms to control society
  - Royal Decree of Prices for Gracias Al Sacar 1795
  - Royal Pragmatic on Marriages 1778
  - Bourbon aren't actually interested in blocking change (e.g changing demographics of colonial society), they just want to be able to control those changes (i.e allow people to declare whiteness)
  - Want to control elite of the colonial society (e.g marriage law)
  - As a result, the Crown was receiving much more revenue form taxes, and had a lot of power over the local elites, against the wills of Creoles
    - Yielded in much more Crown control in administrative, economic, defense, religious aspects of society
    - These were areas that were neglected by the Crown
  - Arguably, Bourbon stretched the system too much with their reforms
