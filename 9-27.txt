Encomienda
  - Begin in reconquista and then expanded to the Caribbean
  - Why was it stronger in Mexico?
    - Sedentary groups are easier to congregate and work together
    - Sedentary groups were used to paying tribute (under the Aztecs), so they would still be paying tribute, just to the Spanish
  - Very important in the development of silver mining
  - Every conquistador got an Encomienda
  - The idea that everyone gets an encomienda causes mass Spanish migration to the new world
    - This was unsustainable
  - Priority in giving out encomienda
    - High ranking in conquistador
    - Close ties to people with high ranking
  - Spanish land grabbing
    - Spanish settlers end up with land but with no laborers to work it
    - Later the Crown formalizes land grabbing and makes the Natives permanently lose their land
  - Church and encomienda tied through conversion
  - Encomienda recipients must be ready at all times with weapon and horse to put down native uprising
  - Trade creates network between Spanish and colonies
    - Merchant head will stay in Spain and assign people to go to Latin America for them
    - Panama and Veracruz utilized for moving products in and out
    - Sons of merchants want to become wealthy and move to Latin America - wind up staying there & raising families

Artisans
  - Have few apprentices to help assist them
  - Black/native people work with these artisans are apprentices

Mining
  - Hispaniola was the first place they had mines
    - Started in rivers
  - Indigenuous slaves provided labor
  - Gold mining in Colombia was a fully fledged enterprise
  - However, otherwise gold mining was not as prominent as silver mining on the continent
  - Spanish moved people from Central Mexico to be used a labor force in the mines
  - Merchants invest in mine owner to exploit the mine
