Secularization - Replacing regular clergy with secular clergy
Cartagena
Jose De Acosta - Clergyman who wrote chronicles documenting life in the colonies
-----------------

Mature period
  - Defined by secular clergy
    - Have the privilege to write testaments (compared to normal clergy)
  - Afterlife is important: People often secured member of clergy to pray for their afterlife
  - More accepting of Creole
  - Church becomes very wealthy
    - Church becomes more and more Creole
    - Church is also main sponsor of artistic production
    -


1749 - By decree, any parish in the hand of regular clergy must go to secular clergy
  - Interest of the king to limit the access of regular clergy because they are seen ??
  - Jesuits are the exception for regular clergy -- their numbers explode while other groups stablize/decline
  - Jesuits training and converting Creoles in cities, also converting indigenous people
    - Jesuit's efforts concentrated in Northern Mexico (also modern day Southern US) & Paraguay
    - Church become very wealthy because they control key parts of Latin America
    - In later parts of mature period, they are expelled


Secular vs Regular clergy
  - Inquisition
    - Two tribunals (one in Mexico City and other in Lima) set up in 1571
    - 3rd tribunal set up in Cartagena in 1610
      - Caused by spike in Spanish immigration -> Colombia (bc gold mining)
  - Brazil never has Inquisition set up (Portugal was not that invested in converting the population)
  - Inquisition has jurisdiction over everyone except indigenous
    - Why not indigenous? They were classified as New Christians that needed time for conversion
    - Monitor people from Europe who converted to Catholicism (e.g Jewish origins)
    - Watch out for blaphsemy, bigomy, sorcery
    - Inquisition in the New World was a lot smaller than that in Spain
  - 1580 - 1640
    - Portugal and Spanish Crown unified under Spain
      - King of Portugal dies with no heirs
    - Worrying for many Portugese in Brazil since they were of Jewish origin
    - Church confiscated the property of many wealthy Portugese merchants via the Inquisition (even if people are acquitted)

Female religious order (nuns):
  - Convents established in late 16th to early 17th century (in Brazil it was late 17th)
  - Two paths for women in society
    - Married into proper family
    - Become a nun
  - Convenants
    - Modern day: Secluded from daily life, still mostly women
    - Back then: Urban phenomenon (set up to be secluded but very opposite in practice), nuns meet a lot of society through parlors and are otherwise in close contact with the city
      - Every one has an associated chapel (chapels are wealthy and thus support local music & arts)
      - Even entire apartments can be converted to convents
      - People who live in convents
        - Full scale reproduction of hierachy of colonial society (AND reproduction of ethnicity in society)
        - Hierarchy
          - Highest ranking nun (Abbess) - usually Creole
          - Council of nuns to Abbess
          - Normal nuns ? (double check this)
          - Servants & slaves
        - Other women who live in convent
          - Widows
          - Victims of domestic abuse (no other institution in place to help these women)
          - Women who are meant for punishment (adultery, sexual misbehaviors, theft)
            - Women don't go to prison
          - Orphans & children
      - Convents are very fluid spaces in both structure and the people who live there
      - Indigenous nuns live in separate spaces and can never achieve the same status as Creole nuns
        - Indigenous men are shut out from being part of religious orders in late 16th century
    - A male runs the business of a convent (usually a close relative of the abbess)
    - Usual fees & taxes get funneled to convents
      - Female convents become banks (esp since they are sitting in the middle of a city & have lots of wealth)
    - Having a daughter in the convent means you get access to a special line of credit with very low interest rates
      - All a game for families to try to get access to resources in the convent
  - Libraries are only in monasteries and convents

Two universities in the new world: Mexico City and Lima
  - Universities are royal institutions (not set up by church)
  - End up training a lot of clergymen and also are staffed/faculty by members of the clergy
  - Focus on three topics: Theology, Law, Medicine
  - Lima's university also contains study of indigenous languages
  - Women are not allowed to be trained in universities
  - Students typically come from courts of Viceroyalty & of archbishop

Picture:
  - An inquisition in Cartagena
    - There is a mass balance -- weighing the soul for innocence
    - Window is facing the public square -- it allows people to drop in anonymous tips
  - Tapestry made of feathers
  - Angel with a gun
  - A whole industry that created mini images of saints: People use this as currency to communicate and ask favors from saints
  - Hospital (restored)
  - Convent
    - Nuns going into a convent
    - A nun wearing a seal (reveals status of a nun)
    - A dead nun (turn around the seal)
    - Library in convent
