Rebellion
  - This isn't a period of rebellion
  - Sources of Tensions
    - between Jesuits and everyone else
    - between Imperial powers
    - in Mexico, a lot of Spanish versus indigenous tension

Rebellion of late 18th century
  - Quito is the first (1765)
    - Mestizos taking up arms against colonial authorities imposing tax reforms
    - Government reforms pick up speed in the second half of 1700's
    - Since Spanish decided to send Andes silver to Buenos Aires rather than to Caribbean, Peru has been losing money (money isn't going through them anymore)
    - Quito economy is stagnating as a result
  - Rebellion of the Andes 1780-82
    - Refers to area within Peru and Bolivia
    - Tupacamaru II (a name chose for himself)
      - Claimed Incan descent that gave him privilege and power
      - Educated by the Jesuits, Mestizo, speaks Cachua and Spanish (very similar to Juan Santos)
      - Very connected to the elite within Cuzco
      - Rebellion is bigger than that of Atahualpa
      - Lots more populous support, and becomes very very violent
      - May 1781 Tupacamaru is captured and executed
      - Before execution, the rebellion ends up spreading even further to Bolivia
    - Rebellion between La Paz and Chayanta
      - Led by Tupac Katari, self-chose the name for himself; doesn't claim descendance from Inca
      - Violence from the bottom takes over
      - Katari is captured and executed in 1781
    - Execution of the leader fragments and ends the movements
    - The factor of the elite mobilizing the working class is much more pronounced within the indigenous uprisings here
  - New Grenada 1781
    - Rebellion of middle and poor groups
    - Reaction to new taxation
  - Inconfidencia Minera (Tiradentes)
    - Rebellion in Brazil
    - Remember the name of the leader of this rebellion
    - Leader who gets executed before rebellion is able to become a fight for independence
    - Led by the middle class
  - None of the above rebellions go more than attacking local officials who are implementing reforms (no independence)
    - Rebellions get squashed too quickly before becoming full-fledged independence movements
  - Revolt of the Tailors 1799
    - First claim of independence
    - Led by black slaves and mulattos and free blacks
    - Follow claims of the French Revolution and Haitian rebellion in 1791 and declare independence of Brazil and ban of slavery
  - Mexico Hidalgo 1810
    - Clear call for independence
  - All of these rebellions are led by members of the elite (upper-middle class)
    - Leaders have the vision for the rebellion
    - They create an alliance with the lower classes, who have the power and the arms
    - All leaders are Creoles (have the bulk of the grievances under the tax reformations)
    - The Crown is consolidating monopolies, removing sources of revenues for the Creoles
    - More and more peninsulars appointed to key administrative roles in the colonies
    - A lot of the revolting classes have standards of living dropping, or are in booming areas but are excluded from the economic growth
    - Rebellion is the convergence of all levels (economic, fiscal, social relations) - need to react to all the changes

Document (concentrate on first document 303-305)
  - Where: Tarma and/or Jauga within the Andes (inland highland from Lima)
  - When: 1742 (exact beginning of first rebellion of Andes)
  - Who: Third person on pg 305 (Garcia)
  - What:
    - Juan Santos Atahualpa is the leader of the rebellion
      - Juan is culturally mestizo with plans to get rid of Spanish in the area
      - Descendant of Incan (Juan gave himself the Atahualpa last name)
      - Educated by Jesuits
    - Blacks in the Andes because of Potosi, and there is tension between indigenous and blacks (blacks are perceived as the middlemen of the Spanish, i.e a threat)
    - Weird complex relationship between Catholic religion versus Church
    - Intensions of the friars
      - Friars initially thought they could work with Atahualpa
      - Later realized the rebellion became too violent to work with
    - Plans to bring back the Incan empire

Movement for a new Incan empire falls apart with the death of Juan
  - The movement faded away
  - The Spanish felt they still had control over the area, didn't hurt the Spanish too much
  - Spanish thought this was an area that needs to bring more indigenous people out into the Spanish economy (causes more tensions with indigenous people)
  - This rebellion opens up a bunch of tensions with indigenous leaders on one side and the indigenous class on the other

Why were the Quito and Andes rebellion not successful?
  - Geography is hard to move militias around
  - Indigenous classes were not mobilized enough
