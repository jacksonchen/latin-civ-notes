Import points

  - Vice Royalties are the representatives of the king in the colonies
    - Apply the executive power of the king
  - Every official within the Vice Royalty have freedom to apply and interpret the King's rules

  - Reflection
    - Merchants initially come to make money in latin america before going back
      - But they discover that they end up becoming entangled in the local community
      - i.e the Latin American elite end up just staying in Latin America
    - Indigenous people tend to be in the countryside with their communities
    - Note that Spain only established their presence 100 years ago, but are able to implement Residencia and Visita within such a short time period
  - Trade & Commerce
    - Earliest version: Checkpoints that every ship must go through to track taxes & what comes/goes
    - Later: Merchants Guild (Consulado)
      - If you're not a merchant, you must join one of these guilds in order to be able to trade
    - How Trade is organized (Philip System or Flota)
      - Fleet system to know exactly when ships leave Spain & Latin America
      - Competition with other European powers
      - 1550's: Caribbean is a dominant area of activities (easy geographic access to the rest of the continent)
      - Convoys of ships are protected by military ships
        - Deflects against pirates
      - Coming in -> Go to Mexico City & Lima
        - Coming back: Everyone goes to Havana (i.e Mexico City -> Havana, Lima -> Havana)
      - The Church is actually putting in resources to this (priests in Latin Am. take salaries, etc)
        -> Patronato Real
          - The alliance between the Church & Spain to rule over the new lands
        -> Puts power under the Spain Crown since they control the land
    - The earlier Spaniards get to Latin America = the higher they can climb the social ladder
