Iberia
  - Some Christian kingdoms in the North
  - Start in the 8th century
    - Umayyads conquered much of peninsula, but Asturias remained Christian
    - Coexistence between Jews, Muslims, and Christians
  - Reconquista
    - Spanish kingdoms in the north pushed down against the Kingdom of Cordoba
    - 1492 Christian states allied together to finally defeat the Muslim kingdom (and expelled them)
  - 5 areas of Iberian Peninsula
    - Portugal (separate Kingdom)
    - Kingdom Navarre
    - Kingdom of Aragon
    - Grenada
    - Kingdom of Castile
      - Biggest role of conquest of Latin America, since they have the largest area and population in Iberia
  - Timeline for unification
    - 1469: Marriage of Isabel of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon unified the two kingdoms (but still functioned as separate political entities)
    - 1516: First king to unify Spain
    - Coming together of new sailing technology and the need for gold for the new monarchies caused Latin American history to happen the way it did
  - Conversion from Islam -> Christian rule
    - The Spanish repurposed Mosques into Churches rather than building new structures
  - Social structure
    - Sedentary
    - Stratified structure; king and power is at the top; nobility below that; then priests, lawyers, medicinal people; then merchants; then peasants & servants
    - Spain's merchants are foreigners (Venetians, gymenies)
      - Portugal's merchant class was much more inbred
    - Slavery was not really a thing
      - Christians and Muslims did enslave each other on occasion, but it was never permanent
    - Corporations: Groups you belong to with responsibilities that are codified
      - Explain why left so many documents/code when colonizing Latin America
    - Limpieza de Sangre: Purity of blood in Spain; certain offices in the government and of the king can only be given to these people
  - Governance structure
    - King is the key reference point
    - King rules with the help of the high court (he appoints these people)
      - The king and the high court try to balance tension between all of the nobility
    - Church is next in power
      - King has power over the Church since he appoints bishops, etc
      - Many things are discussed between the Crown and the Church
      - Church is split into two groups: secular and sect
    - Inquisition (1478) is pursued in order to control the Muslims and Jews
  - How Spain unified territory
    - Slow; start conquering individual towns, control the people there, convert the land into Catholicism
      - Encomienda: Group of people entrusted to you (happens under successful conquests); you need to control and convert those people
      - Capitulacion: Legal contract between the king and the captain of the expedition, that the captain commits to conquering the portion of the territory
        - In exchange, captain gets titles, riches, etc
    - These two techniques (encomienda, capitulacion) were later applied to Latin American conquest
    - Spain already had experience conquering foreign lands in the Atlantic (i.e the Canary Islands)
  - Andualusia (Castile's south) - becomes area for development in ship building and commerce

Portugal
  - Reached maturity sooner since they have smaller portion of land
  - Since Portugal faced the Atlantic, sailing and trade started there sooner
  - Feitoria: Outpost on coasts for Portugese bases to access local resources and export them
    - Purely for trade, not for military reasons
    - Did not plan any sort of conversion when they opened outposts on the coast
  - Utilized local sailors

Documents
  - Under Muslim kingdom, Christian and Jews performed the lowly jobs
  - Relationship between Muslim and Christians
    - Separate living areas
    - Cleanliness was looked down upon
  - Fear of integration
