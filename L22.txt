War of the Emboabas 1708-9
Methuen Treaty 1703
Marquis De Pombal
Colonia Do Sacrmento
---------------------

Background: Brazil Sugar Phase (17th century)
  - Northeast Brazil has a lot of sugar plantation
  - Starts in the late 16th century, goes to 1640-1650
  - Dutch occupation in Northeast Brazil, while winning that part back, many of the sugar plantations get destroyed
    - This contributes to the decline of sugar
  - Driven by slavery
  - The Portugese elite in Brazil were created through the sugar economy
    - Compare this to Latin America, where the elite were already elites in Spain when migrating over

Brazil Golden Phase
  - Move from sugar economy to gold economy
  - Pombal reform
  - Starts late 1600 and ends 1750's
  - Mined primarily in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo (i.e Southern Brazil)
    - Movement away from coast, and settling more inland
  - 1763: The new Brazilian capital is set to be in Rio de Janeiro (from the coast in Bahia)
    - Capital is moved wherever part of the country is being developed
  - Gold area used to be a fringe area and sparsely populated; but then develops to become the core of Brazil within decades
  - Creates tensions between existing residents in Sao Paulo and the new gold prospect families
    - War in 1708-1709: War to get rid of the new migrants
    - Worries the Portugese Crown, intervenes to protect the migrants
  - The Crown establishes a gold tax (tithe real?)
    - However, comparing to silver mining (hard to hide mining activity), gold mining is very easy to hide
    - The Crown wasn't making enough taxes in gold because there was so much evasion, so they start taxing income
  - 1720's: Diamonds are also discovered in this area
  - Only slaves doing gold mining here (unlike in Colombia)
    - Portugese relocate slaves from Northeast or import them
    - Brazil becomes the biggest slave market because Northeast Brazil needed slaves to rebuild sugar economy, and new gold economy in the south
      - Growth in sugar demand because of the Haitian Revolution = collapse of sugar production in Caribbean
    - 2 million slaves imported during the century
      - Many come from Aruba, the same part of Africa = fostering a culture among slaves
  - Also the very southern parts of Brazil are developed (Sul region)
    - This land is extremely fertile, growth in agriculture to support the mining industry further north
  - A lot of mixing  rise in interracial groups
  - Church presence increases
    - First time in Brazil seeing secular Church being strong

Impact of gold on economy
  - Portugal mainland doesn't have much manufacturing/income from before, but use gold as cash to spend in the European market
  - Portugal has allied with Britain (compared to Spain, France)
    - Methuen Treaty
    - Portugal and Britain sell products at the agreed rate to the rest of European countries

Brazilian Reforms
  - Marquis De Pombol
    - Active during 1750-1777
    - Minister who is in charge of carrying out reforms in Brazil
  - Portugal wants to develop & defense the new areas of gold mining
  - Portugal essentially becomes a satellite of England, a constant source of tension between the two states; this makes Portugal want agency over Brazil
  - Crown appoints ministers at the top that replace a lot of the roles of the council (very similar to Spain)
  - Crown appoints a lot of former military generals into governorship posts -> statement around defense
    - Note they don't go for full military mobilization in Brazil like Spain did
  - Set up monopolies
  - Contraband measures
    - Set up boards of control at key ports that are supposed to keep out contraband
  - Pombal is the driving force behind the expulsion of Jesuits

European wars are all split between Spain, France vs Portugal, England
  - When England took Havana, France took Rio de Janiero
  - But this didn't have the same affect, since Rio wasn't the capital yet, and wasn't that important as Havana was to Spain
  - Core of European tension is in La Plata
    - Colonia Do Sacremento was outpost at the head of Rio de La Plata, lying under Brazil, owned by Spain
    - Thorn in the side of Spanish because it was unable to be defended, and all the contraband from England was shipped it with no restraint
    - The previous treaty exchanged modern day Paraguay for Colonia (Spain lost Paraguay but gained Colonia)
    - 1828: This territory is created into the state of Uruguay

Jesuits
  - Educational institutions collapsed with the expulsion of Jesuit
  - Jesuits cross Pombol by trying take into control indigenous people (the Portugese Crown is trying to foster mixing between native and Portugese)

Comparisons with Spain
  - Portugal had no change in dynasty, yet reforms still happened
  - Portugese elite and Brazilian elite are a lot more harmonious together, unlike in Spanish Latin Am where there was tension between peninsulars and the local elites
  - Figure out more differences between Portugal vs Spain

Document
  - Where: Rio de Janeiro (Southern Brazil -- DO NOT say Brazil, that's too vague)
  - When: 1769
  - What: Gold mining is already happening, no longer the boom of gold mining
    - Talking about reasons to go in to the gold rush even though it is winding down
      - Ability to capture runaway slaves and re-sell them
    - Good areas for agriculture
    - For whom is this account written?
      - For the governor who is able to grant lands
      - Read like conquistador's reports (this is the hero, hoping to get land grants)
      - "Conquering" the land
