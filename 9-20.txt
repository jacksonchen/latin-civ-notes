Conquest Phase
  - 1521 to 1560's
  - Two conquest campaigns from the Caribbean
    - Hispianola -> Panama (1509) -> Peru (1532)
    - Hispianola -> Cuba (1511) -> Mexico (1519)
  - Mexico campaign
    - Hernando Cortez led the campaign, Pedro De Alvarado is second in command
    - Colonized Cuba 1511
      - Appointed by governor of Cuba to lead campaign in Mexico
      - Rumors that there was a big and wealthy empire across the sea
    - Expedition was called off by higher authority, but he sailed anyways, land in Yucatan
    - Rescued a Spanish friar who was shipwrecked in Yucatan (this friar knew the local language of the Mayans)
    - Women were gifted by the Aztecs to the Spanish (as gesture of good will)
      - Malintzin was sold as a slave from Mayan to Aztecs, so she could translate (Nahua -> Mayan)
      - BTW, the friar could translate from Mayan to Spanish
      - Hence this Spanish crew could now communicate with the Aztecs
    - Start playing one indigenuous community against the other
      - They figured out who is resentful against the Aztecs
    - They visit Moctezuma, study each other, emperor gives Spanish lots of gifts to get them to leave
      - Spanish later decide that they need to capture Moctezuma
    - Governor of Cuba sent an expedition to get Cortez because he left illegally
      - Cortez hears of this, sends his most trusted men to the coast to fight (or persuade) the incoming expedition
      - The rest of Cortez's expedition attacked Tenochtitlan during a celebration but get expelled
    - Cortez brings his troops back upon hearing of the tactical mistake and put Tenochtitlan under seige
    - Moctezuma gets killed during the siege (probably by discontented people in the city, reason not fully known)
    - Smallpox gets into the city and spreads really quickly -> This made Tenochtitlan fall
    - Cuauhtemoc was the last emperor of the Aztecs, and he was executed in 1525 and with him the Aztec royal lineage
    - Once Tenochtitlan fell, the rest of Mexico fell quickly (many people in the empire paid tribute to
      the top, so capturing the top won everything)
  - Peru campaign
    - Francisco Pizarro leads the charge, Diego De Almagro is second in command
    - Found indigenuous boys in Panama, brings them back to Spain (they learn Spanish), then back
    - Remember cusco and Kakamata
    - Two sons of the Inca kingdom were fighting
    - Smallbox travelled faster than the Spanish
    - Atahualpa told to kill Huascar
      - Atahualpa is executed by Pizarro a year later
    - Mancoinca escapes the Spanish and sets up another Inca kingdom in Vilcabamba
      - Vilcabamba is much higher and the Spanish didn't get to it until much later
    - People of the Incan empire know of this Vilcabamba kingdom and believe Inca empire would be able to come back one day
    - Pizarro is killed by supporters of Almagro, created even more confusion in the conquest
  - How Spanish were able to win the conquests
    - Indigenuous interpreters
    - Diseases (especially small pox)
    - Launching the first attacks
    - Cause infighting within indigenuous people
  - Natives did fight back

Conquistadors
  - People were self financed (Cortez, Pizarro made lots of money from Hispianola)
  - Captain in charge of expedition was given title + encomienda
  - Groups ranged from 200-500 men
  - No soldiers or military strategy (not much is planned)
  - People who came from Spain had no fortune
  - Violence was a fundamental part of the conquest

Indigenuous people
  - Some allied with Spanish after initial pushback
  - Some decided to react and ally while others fled
    - Sedentary society didn't do this as much

Africans
  - In peripheral parts of the Spanish empire, they lived their own lives
  - In central areas, they were typically slaves

Structure of state
  - Central court and capital
  - Satellite cities around it
  - Zacatecas (1547)
  - Lima is not an indigenuous capital (founded in 1535)
    - The port of Peru is back in Panama
    - Cusco was too inland and too narrow to build anything substantial

Document
  - Remember the date(?)
  - Written in 1533, writing to his father
  - Reasons behind the letter
    - Wants to send money back
    - Wants to keep in touch
    - Can't go back even if he wanted (only married people were allowed to go back)
    - Has a wish for his father
      - Money to take care of the dead
      - He thinks in religious terms (like other Spaniards)
  - Boasting about his enterprise
  - Admitted the Spanish were outnumbered
  - Strong relationship with family despite years without contacting them
  - Died two days after sending the letter (trying to go through the narrow valley to conquer the last Incan state)
