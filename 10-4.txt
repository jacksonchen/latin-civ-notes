==============

Spain @ time of contact: Warfare and cannibalism, conversion
  - started early 15th century
  - Rather than trading outposts, they try to establish presence within the land (i.e build capitals) early on
  - Not much intermarriage with local people
Portugal @ time of contact:
  - Factoria (trading outposts)
    - Heavily fortified
  - their trade route went down Africa (they got slaves through this)
  - 1500, Portugal accidently land on the tip of Brazil
  - Dyewood, luxury good in Europe
    - Exported from Brazil, done simply through trade @ their outposts (1502-1530)
  - Competition from other European powers
    - 1530: Went down to Buenos Aires (violating the treaty with Spain)
    - France started sending ships to extract dyewood starting in 1504
    - Portugal decided they needed to increase their presence in the area
    - 1532: Created a first city near where Sao Paulo is, really established their presence for the first time
    - Lots of intermarriage with local people, perfectly legal (unlike the Spanish)
    - Instead of creating a network of cities together in Brazil, the connections are much stronger w Lisbon
  - 1549: Appoint first governor of Brazil (much slower than Spanish in establishing institutions on the ground)
    - Not quite the same functions of Viceroy
    - Bahia (1549) declared the first capital
      - Governor, other appointed officials live
  - City structure
    - Tend to have varying levels of elevation
    - Important things (governors functions, churches) tend to be in higher elevation (for purposes of defense)
    - Town squares are tiny, if someone marches through, the squares can be sealed off
  - Church
    - Jesuits are the first to arrive and become the most prominent
    - Really there to try to convert people
    - Portugal use religion as a way to control indigenous people
    - Starts a competition amongst European powers to control natives
    - Indigenous people tend to be nonsedentary. The Jesuit try to convert them to be sedentary & practice agriculture
  - Main form of enterprise: Tropical plantation colonies
    - Economy based on plantations (e.g sugar) that is meant to be sold back to Europe
  - By 1600, Portugese were ONLY on the coastline of Brazil, practically no presence inland
  - By 1570, for labor force for plantation, Portugese go inland, capture & enslave natives, and sell them as slaves
  - Conflict between Portugese & natives grow within Sertao -- making it even more less hospitable of a place
  - African slaves
    - Work on the coastline
    - Try to flee to Sertao
    - Not too many African slaves, because transport of slaves is really expensive
    - Only started regular import of slaves starting in the 1560's-1570's
    - Camps often are found with Africans & natives living together (these camps are called Quilombos)
      - These camps are filled w people trying to escape Portugese control
    - Kids of slaves are still slaves, disincentivizing intermarriage with slave class
    - However, free blacks' kids are free
  - Diseases within indigenous people were still bad, but not as bad as in Spanish controlled territory

1750: First real boundary between Spain and Portugal
  - Before this the line was really blurred and people would come and go without regard to any boundaries
