What have we covered with women so far

  Native women vs Spanish women
  Women aren't that often running households
  Women were prevalent within education
  Intermarriage with Natives (Portugese vs Spanish)
  Very low rates of migration of Spanish women in the beginning of the New World
  Women were actively erased from history (Malinche)
  Women -> textile production

Role of women
  - Portugal and Spain had similarities in structure of family
  - Two Laws
    - Siete Partidas, Leyes De Toro, determined what women could or could not do during colonial period
    - Colonial Period - 1870's, family law is based on the two above Laws
  - Principle of Restriction: Women need to be under supervision since they can't be leaders or govern over others
    - Women need to be restricted because they're temperamental
    - Women can be in charge of a hacienda if the male figure declares her to
  - Principle of Protection: Women needed protection, particularly from male authority figure
    - Women don't need jobs because the man can provide for her
    - Dowery is the property of the women
    - Women have economic protections as well (dowery, etc)
  - Men want to control sexual behavior of their wife -> because that could cause illegitimate children
    - Due to 4/5 Legitima where illegitimate children can make claims on the man's property
  - Double moral standard of sexuality
    - Adultery (prosecuted by Spanish law)
      - A woman loses her right to dowery and all her economic protections
      - If caught during the act, she may be killed with no consequences or sent to prison
      - For a man, he could be punished only if it is committed with another married woman or with servants or dependents
        - These punishments can lead to illegitimate children, which is why there are punishments for this
        - Consequences is usually a fine
        - If the wife kills the adulterer, she'll go to prison, but not for the man
    - Marriages cannot happen multiple times unless weird exceptions (like a court anulling of the marriage)
  - Virginity didn't matter when it came to marriage, even for women (women could even have children who would turn into legitimate children after marriage)
  - Spanish law just cares that you marriage eventually (and only once), doesn't matter how you get there
  - Widows are in a special position of power, esp widows from nobility essentially have same legal status & power of men
  - Women engage in occupations around small businesses (e.g sewing)
  - Lower groups in society (e.g poor, mixed groups, free blacks, indigenous people)
    - Marriage isn't even the obvious choice, many relationships are just informal with no need to marry (no social status change)
    - In fact, marriage costs a lot of money and isn't worth it
    - Spanish never cared about these people not marrying, no crackdowns, etc despite the law pretty much forcing marriage at one point
    - High rates of illegitimate children
      - 17th century, Lima 20-40% illegitimacy rate
      - Mining centers, at least 50% of children are illegitimate
    - Exception for Indigenous people still in countryside
      - Level of marriage is still very high
      - Local priests are there pushing people to marry
      - Native people before already have a general practice to get married (and divorced)
    - Indigenous women were a lot more active in production roles (like in beverages)
