Inca empire
  - An early empire with one of the largest territories
  - Formation of the empire
    - Chavin (1000-400 BC) -> Moche and Nazca (200 BC - 700 AD) -> Tiahuanaco (500 - 1000 AD; built around lake Titicaca, highland civ) -> Chimu (800 AD - 1400 AD, coastline civ) -> Inca (start 1438)
  - First Inca emperor descended from deity of the sun (the primary deity)
  - 1438 beginning of expansion (remember this)
  - Expansion ended when the Spanish contact
    - Huaymacapac (emperor ruling Inca died right before Spanish contact)
      - He has two sons (Atahualpa and Huascar)
      - His death led to fight for power between sons, fractured the empire
  - Tawamtimsuyu (land of the 4 parts): The name Incans gave for their own empire

Incan story vs Mesoamerica
  - Environment
    - Inca: High altitude, tallest mountains -> impact living and agriculture
    - Meso: Mountains plateau in central Mexico, easier for agriculture
    - Agriculture
      - Inca: Stratified layers that bend around the mountains. Staple is potatoes and maze in certain areas
        - Terracing
        - Each community owns a set of lands at different altitudes to grow food
      - Meso: Uniform since the land is flat. Staple is corn (cultivated in the lowlands).
  - Organization of the empire
    - Inca: Spans many latitudes, set up system where everything is highly regulated
      - Split into 4 parts
      - Each part, emperor appoints a close member of family to control it
      - 80 provinces (ruler of each province is a relative of the emperor)
      - Every step in the hierarchy of power has blood relations with the emperor
      - Llacta: a local unit (a little bigger than a city)
        - People are linked by kinship/blood
        - Ceremonial center, no one lives there, people go for worship (maybe some priests live there)
        - All of the ayllu live surrounding the center
        - NOT centralized at all, not urbanized
    - Meso: Decently de-centralized (as long as they respect central authority, they have autonomy)
      - Highly urbanized society
  - Structure of society
    - Inca:
      - Nobility
        - Warriors are under thems
      - Priest class -> nobility
      - There isn't a slave class; Stops at the yamacomas class
      - Commoners/peasants would be between the nobles and the yamacomas
    - Meso:
      - Slave under servants
  - Trade
    - Inca:
      - Less of a focus on trade
    - Meso:
      - Wealthy farmers who have high statues and conduct lots of trade

Mita
  - Every male must serve Mita
    - Assigned a set of land to cultivate as a tribute to the emperor
  - System that moves people around to different elevations of farms
  - What people expect in return is that the central state is responsible to take care of them in bad times (drought, war, etc)
  - Not quite exploitation of the commoners because of this relationship between the common people and the king
  - Can be seen later with the rise of nation states in South America

Document Discussion
  - #8 (remember the author)
    - Force resettlement of the people upon conquest
      - 6000-7000 families (massive)
      - Not like Mesoamerica where people move around for tributes
    - Reasons why people were resettled
      - Key tool in keeping control from an Incan standpoint
      - If militias misbehave, Incas will use locals to keep them in check
      - Integrate uniform language and culture around the country
      - Foster trade and to move products around
    - Cultivation of the fields
      - The state supports the poor
      - Then the state cultivates land
      - Then serve the local rule and cultivate the land
      - The last land to be cultivated is the land of the emperor's
  - #10
    - Benevolent perspective of the Incans (written after the conquest)
      - While #8 has a lesser perspective on the Incans (written during the conquest)
    - System of roads and warehouses store clothes, food, weapons
    - War in Inca empire didn't really involve taking prisoners for sacrifices
      - (if they happened, it was linked to particular deities or bad events)
      - This is a big difference compared to Meso America
    - Absense of a written language for Incas
    - Quipu (string of cords with different knots): Way to keep track of goods moving around, tributes being paid
      - Essentially an accounting system
      - Travelers will bring quips with them
      - Not the same as a language though (another difference b/w Incan and Meso civs)
    - Summary
      - Meso is known for writing, calendar, astronomy, pyramids
      - Incans were known for political organization (centralized system) and complex terracing agricultural system

More documents
  - Tupi in Brazil
  - Semi-sedentary
    - Men - hunting
    - Women - basic agriculture
  - Non-sedentary
    - Men - hunting and warfare
    - Women gathering and agriculture
    - Specialization
  - Warfare was more for competition of resources (pretty necessary)
  - When European run into non-sedentary group, they start by trading with them (e.g Tupi in Brazil)
  - When European ran into sedentary group, they either ignore or exterminate them
