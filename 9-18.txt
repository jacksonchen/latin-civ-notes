---------------------------

1495 fully colonized the Canary Islands

Caribbean phase:
  - Begin in 1492
  - Atlantic phase (1492 - 1495)
  - Conquest phase: (1492 - 1521)
    - Institutions, conquest were all gained from the Atlantic phase
    - 1521 when Mexico falls

Columbus
  - Marries into merchant family who runs an outpost near the coast of Africa
  - Was in the right place initially because of the Atlantic phase
  - Once Dias went around the world, he pivoted to the Caribbean phase
  - He was in a good position to explore the Americas -- gets funding but also gets a share of the riches
  - Second voyage in 1493 (70 ships, over 1000 people)
  - Overall 4 voyages
  - Died in disgrace

Spanish Portugese Tension
  - Pope was the arbitrator
  - 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas (remember this date)
    - Spain and Portugal agreement to divide the world in two parts for ownership of new lands
  - Portugese events that made it favorable
    - Pedro Alvares Cabral accidently landed in Brazil when going down Africa
    - Vasco Da Gama finally made it to India through Cape of Africa

1538 Mercator Map, finally first mapped understanding of North and South America and its scope
  - Columbus died without realizing the scope and size of the Americas

Quinto - Tax that the crown collected on materials mined (gold, silver, etc) from the new lands

1509 - 1513: Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Cuba
  - Exploited lands and moved people around
  - Nicaragua is the first establishment on the continent
  - Imported lots of African slaves

1496 - Founded Santo Domingo (first city of the Americas)

Casa de Contratacion
  - Founded in 1503
  - Essentially a checkpoint of who is coming and going, what resources are being moved
  - Get license from the king to travel, must pay taxes to board ship

Council for the Indies
  - 1524: Conquest of Mexico
  - Society comes first, institutions come later (Council for the Indies came much later after settlement)

Encomienda (key institution)
  - Grant of people (NOT a grant of land)
  - Group of people assigned to a captain who are to work for the captain

Cacique
  - Strike deal with local indigenous people, that this community will work for a specific Spaniard
  - Indigenous people get into these deals to avoid having the Spanish wipe out their community
  - Also a way for indigenous leaders to stay in power
  - Codifies the interaction b/w Spanish and indigenous people (necessary for encomienda)

Naborias
  - Servants of the indigenous lords
  - Spanish used them to make it their working class
  - There was some slavery but it failed to work because they died too quickly

1521
  - Caribbean pretty much had no more indigenous people (90% of them died)
  - Spanish population is still very small in the Caribbean
  - The Caribbean--even though small--gives us all the institutions that they later use in Latin America

Documents
  - Lots of infighting within the Spanish
  - Mosques were burned
