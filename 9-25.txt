Themes:
  - Debates for what Spain should be doing post-conquest
  - Carribbean phase and the controversys raised by the conquest
  - Great Debate of Yadoli

Background
  English, French, Dutch are not actors in this landscape yet
  In terms of resources (gold, etc), many people wonder if what the Spanish is doing is legitimate
  Can Spain justify their right to be there?
  Extinction of Caribbean Natives make people question Spain's moral consequences and legitimacy

Dominican Friar (Antonio De Montesinos) arrived to Hispianola, saw indigenous people's deaths & exploits
  - 1511 Pronounced a ceremony that inflamed the local Spanish community: questioned if Catholics should uphold their treatment of Natives
  - Dominican influence is still strong in Latin America today
  - Local Spanish community worried that this news would spread to Europe (and to the church)
  - As a result, people who were not directly involved in the enterprise of conquest were removed back to Europe

Juan Lopez De Palacios Rubio
  - Made the first draft of The Requirement (the document read to Native Americans before conquest)
  - Came up with two ideas in response to Montesinos' sermon:
    - Some human beings are naturally slaves (they are inferior, that's the way they are born)
      - Spanish have a civilizing mission over these indigenous people
    - Spanish Crown has all the right to be there because the Pope literally gave the Spanish the right to colonize this land
  - Crown's reaction
    - Law of Burgos (1512)
      - First position of the Crown was on the side of the indigenous people
      - Set rules on the Spanish in terms of incomienda and conversion
      - Detail how the native labor force can or cannot be used
      - Made conversion of the Native Americans the highest priority, rather than using their labor
      - The Spanish Crown was the first such European power to legally curtail their own colonial expeditions
    - New Laws (1542) -> See below

Two factions in this debate
  - Montesinos and the Crown
  - Palacios and the Dominicans

Debate during 1530-1540:
  - Francisco De Vitoria
    - Dominican
    - Very popular journalist in Europe
    - Upholds the position of Montesinos
    - Uses the language of a journalist, but not actually on the ground in the new world (like Montesinos was)
    - Points he makes
      - Native Americans cannot be considered natural slaves at all
        - Some have legitimate monarchies
        - They also have a sense of property, literacy
      - Dismisses the power of the property - Pope supported the position of the Spanish
        - Objective of the Spanish to convert, that's the only way the Spanish could justify being there
        - Sacrifice was something that needed to be eradicated -> conversion to the Church
        - Spain cannot claim conquest of land that is already being occupied by others, they can only
          claim a spiritual conquest
  - New Laws (1542)
    - Charles V (1516 - 1556) issued this Law
      - Charles unifies a good chunk of Europe as well as the colonies, one of the most powerful monarchies in European
      - Philip II (his son) later takes over the crown
    - Two points for things to remember
      - No more incomienda is granted to anyone
      - Existing incomiendas goes back to the King upon expiration/death of the contract
      - Incomienda can only be used for tribute and not labor
        - People cannot be forced to work the land for the Spanish
        - They can work their own land, but instead just pay tribute to Spain
    - Pretty much the Spanish Crown says "stop", unheard of in terms of colonial power
    - Why would Charles V do something this extreme?
      - Deep concern within the monarchy in how the Spanish Crown is perceived within Europe
      - Religious reasons
      - Potential insurrection, instability
      - Maneuver to gain political power and bring under control the overseas Spanish colonies
        - There is a new elite class in Latin America that has at this point acted pretty autonomously
        - Charles V did not give a shit about human rights, he just wanted control over these elites
  - After the Spanish conquest
    - Civil War in Peru between two Spanish factions
    - One element of the New Law says people who were involved in the civil war are never allowed to be involved in the incomienda
  - The viceroy is killed by the locals to stop the implementation of the laws
    - Charles V is forced to reconsider
    - Ends up amending the new laws to not take away the incomienda, but he still limited it
    - The debates comes down to the nature of indigenous people and the right of Spaniards

Document (Las Casas)
  - 1502 went to Hispaniola
    - Family received an incomienda grant because of that
  - 1507 in Spain is ordained a priest
  - Send back to Hispaniola to convert the people, and get another incomienda to support himself
  - Once he gets there, he sees the conditions himself and renounces the incomienda & becomes a supporter of the Natives

Document 3
  - 1552
  - View on Native Americans
    - Passive, no resistance, peaceful, not confrontations
    - Desperate

Document 4
  - Pay attention to language used to describe Spanish
  - Uses terms like "little men" to describe indigenous People- Look at last paragrpah 72, he calls them uncivilized
  - Document favors the side of the Spanish

Human Sacrifice
  - Indigenous people should not be allowed in engage in this activity
  - Las Casas says it more positively: human sacrifice needs to be cultivated out of them, but naturally they are virtuous

Las Casas
  - System to protect indigenous People- System to restrain the elite in Latin America
Secula (? the other guy)
  - Under his views, people would continue dying, and resources would continue pouring into the crown

Spain already conquered every group in Latin America by 1560
  - First colonist society has already been building up
  - Keeping things the way they are, things will continue to flow and society will "find a way"
  - In the end, the status quo was what ended up being pursued :(
  - Europeans assumed that they were better than everyone else
  - On the side of Las Casas (REMEMBER THIS)
    - The image of the indigenous people are fearful, powerless, no agency over their situation
    - Aztecs and Incas were definitely more sophisticated than their colonizers
  - 90% of indigenous people died in Mexico
  - 11 million dead in South America
  - 5 million dead in Caribbean
