Purpose of lecture is to give context of indigenous society
  - The narrative of a decline of indigenous society
  - Need to understand every period

Mexico
  - Before conquest: Head of each household (usually the eldest) runs/operates land to cultivate within an altepetl
    - The land is completely theirs; they can pass it down through inheritance
    - They lose land if they don't use or cultivate the land
    - Are also able to buy/sell marginal lands at the end of their land
  - Mature period
    - Many conflicts between altepetl's
    - More and more Spanish moving into the countryside
    - Corregidor de Indios =  deals with places where there is a lot of indigenous people but no encomienda system in place
    - Land ownership is a story of conflicts, doesn't change the way indigenous people see their lands
    - No written record of land ownership during conquest period; this changes during mature period
    - Spain wanted indigenous people to pay taxes with silver
    - Market
      - Indigenous market moves from bartering to using silver currency & Peso's
      - Adoption of Spanish practices of mortgages, money lending
      - Luxury goods - Handled more and more by Spanish rather than by indigenous people
    - Indigenous households
      - Originally many separate buildings (one for kitchen, one for living, etc)
      - Moving towards Spanish households with one primary building
      - Brought pictures of saints into their households
        - Previously they dedicated a building for deities

Andes
  - End of the Inca story was at 1572 with the capture of Tupacamaru
  - Repartimiento? (there was no more encomienda at this time)
  - Much fewer Spanish living here, so local indigenous structure is very preserved from before
  - Forasteros never received land ownership since they were foreigners, always looked for contract work to sustain
  - Forasteros become very prominent during the mature period
  - Ayllu is the owner of the land of the community and distributes it
  - In Central Mexico, altepetls are losing land, but ayllus continue having ownership over land and keep passing it on
  - Kuraka also begin acquiring land and wealth; start getting in tension with ayllus
  - Reparto is prevalent in the Andean market (Mexico market, reparto wasn't needed since it was so fluid already)
    - Imposed sale of iron, steel, wool, etc
  - Household
    - Very few documents around this, we don't know much
    - Communities are opening up from conquest -> mature period
    - Even harder to spread religion in Andes than it was in Mexico (and it was already hard to do so in Mexico)
  - 1610 - 1670: Spanish campaign to send people to each household and check on religious status
  - Incans still believe they will eventually be reunited into an Incan Empire (this thought doesn't exist in Mexico)
    - Actually almost overthrew the Spanish through this dream
  - Vertical organization is still persistent in Incan societies (Spanish could not break this down)
  - Big divide between high lands and low lands (high Andes versus Lima & coastline)
    - Mixing was very different as well
    - Much fewer mestizos & mixed people in the high Andes (compared to Mexico)
